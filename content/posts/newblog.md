# The New Project Segfault Blog
Welcome to the new Project Segfault Blog! We used Ghost before, but we decided to migrate to Hugo, because it's much faster and easier to customize. With the old blog, we were going to make our own theme, but we never did because we got too lazy. With Hugo, we can just use HTML and CSS. That allowed me to steal the website's design to make the blog consistent with the website. Looks good, right?
